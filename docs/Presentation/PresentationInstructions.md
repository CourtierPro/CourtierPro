# 420-N61-LA Final Project 2 W2026
## Project Presentation and Demo Instructions

**Presentation Date:** Monday, February 23, 2026

**Total time per team:** 45 minutes (including questions). 3 minutes between each team for change-over.

Present the system to your client, their employees, their customers, and other stakeholders.

---

## Focus 1 – Team – 80 points (80%)

### Aspect 1 — Addressing Customer Requirements (10%)

You must show how you met every requirement. Please note that during this project and in the documents such as "Project Proposal" or "Project Milestones" we used use-case technique to document all the requirements. So, for addressing this aspect, you are asked to:

- Review the use-cases as they have been revised/refined throughout the project and justify the revisions.
- If any requirement was not met, show evidence that the customer agreed to that requirement being dropped.
- If any requirement was modified, show evidence that the customer agreed to that requirement being modified.

For this aspect, refer to docs/Requirements/RequirementsStatus.md

### Aspect 2 — Showcasing the System's Functionalities (20%)

"Sell" the system to the client, their employees, their customers, and other stakeholders.

- Explain and demo how using your system will improve their productivity, their decision-making, and, potentially, attract new customers.
- Focus on scenarios/use cases for each type of user.
- The demo should give evidence that the agreed upon requirements (see Aspect 1) and acceptance criteria have been fully implemented in the system.
- Ensure that the flow and organization of the demo is smooth.

### Aspect 3 — Adhering to Proposal Requirements (15%)

You must demonstrate that the system has all the mandatory features specified in the project proposal instructions:

- At least 10 main use cases that include multiple roles (authorization must be demonstrated)
- N-tier architecture
- Internationalization and localization
- Authentication
- Several reports and data entry forms

*(Note: the calculation or transformation problem is graded separately in Aspect 4.)*

### Aspect 4 — Addressing Transformation Requirement (10%)

You must demonstrate that your system performs:

- A major transformation, or
- Complex calculation in multiple stages.

### Aspect 5 — Adhering to Accessibility Requirements (10%)

You must demonstrate that the system meets the Quebec standard for web accessibility features (WCAG 2.0 AA):

- **HTML Validation:** show output of validator.w3.org for all pages of your web application
- **Colour Contrast:** Install the WCAG Color Contrast Chrome browser extension and keep it on as you demo your system – tell us about any item that earns an X.
- **WebAIM:** show the output of the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (wave.webaim.org) for all pages of your web application
- Demonstrate any other accessibility functionality that you have incorporated into your web application

### Aspect 6 — Quality of the System (15%)

You will be evaluated on the overall perception of quality, robustness and completeness of the system, both in terms of UI and functionality. The following are some of the items, non-exclusive, that will be considered:

- Use the deployed version of the system
- Show that the system is fully responsive (demonstrate in tablet and cellphone sizes)
- Show that the system prevents invalid inputs
- Show that the system handles exceptions properly
- Show that the system handles routing properly
- Show that the system does not reveal confidential information in the browser tools

If the system has bugs or crashes during the demo, that will impact this aspect.

## Focus 2 – Individual – 20 points (20%)

### Aspect 7 — Professional Presentations (15%)

The presentation is a high-quality endeavor both in terms of the slides presented as well as in terms of the presenters' professionalism. Remember that you are trying to "sell" the product to your client, their employees, and customers. The following are some of the main criteria that will be considered:

- Student's appearance
- Student's behaviour both when speaking and when not speaking
- Student speaks their fair share of the time
- Student speaks clearly
- Student pays attention to the audience, involves them in the presentation
- The presentation is clear and has a natural flow

### Aspect 8 — Constructive Feedback (5%)

Complete the feedback for each presentation, providing meaningful comments about why you would or wouldn't use the system if you were a member of the system's target audience. What did you like about it, what didn't you like about it?

## Rubric

### Aspect 1 — Addressing Customer Requirements (Points × 2)

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Not Addressed | The team has not met the objective. No meaningful evidence is provided that customer requirements were addressed or approved. |
| 1 | Novice | The team has not met the objective. Few customer requirements are adequately addressed; revisions are largely unjustified; little or no evidence of customer agreement is provided. |
| 2 | Developing | The team has partially met the objective. Many customer requirements are weakly addressed; use-case revisions are poorly justified; limited or inconsistent evidence of customer agreement is provided. |
| 3 | Adequate | The team has mostly met the objective. Customer requirements are generally addressed; some use-case revisions lack clear justification; evidence of customer agreement for unmet or modified requirements is incomplete. |
| 4 | Proficient | The team has met the objective. Most customer requirements are addressed through revised use cases; justifications are mostly clear; evidence of customer agreement is provided for most unmet or modified requirements, with minor gaps. |
| 5 | Exemplary | The team has exceeded the objective. All customer requirements are clearly addressed through the revised use cases; all revisions are well justified; any unmet or modified requirements include clear evidence of customer agreement. |

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Not Addressed | The team has not met the objective. No meaningful system demo is provided. |
| 1 | Novice | The team has not met the objective. The demo is poorly structured, not use case–driven, and lacks coordination across team members; little evidence of implemented requirements or acceptance criteria is provided. |
| 2 | Developing | The team has partially met the objective. The demo shows limited use of a use case or scenario approach; flow between team members is weak or disjointed; evidence of requirement implementation is incomplete; system value is unclear. |
| 3 | Adequate | The team has mostly met the objective. The demo uses some use case or scenario structure but lacks consistency or smooth transitions between team members; coverage of user scenarios is basic; evidence of implemented requirements is partial. |
| 4 | Proficient | The team has met the objective. The system is effectively presented through a mostly use case–driven demo; the flow across team members is generally smooth; most user scenarios are covered; evidence shows that most requirements and acceptance criteria are implemented, with minor gaps. |
| 5 | Exemplary | The team has exceeded the objective. The system is compellingly presented through a use case–driven demo that flows naturally across all team members; scenarios are clearly tailored to each user type; clear evidence is provided that all agreed-upon requirements and acceptance criteria are fully implemented; the demo convincingly demonstrates productivity, decision-making, and customer-value benefits. |
